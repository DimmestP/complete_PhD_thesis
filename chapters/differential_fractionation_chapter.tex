Diff Frac: Normalisation of RNA-Seq data to enable comparison across experiments remains a non-trivial task. 

DESeq2, TPM, spike-ins, and normalising genes all have assumptions that can often be broken.

Modelling errors using Bayesian statistical models and implementing quality experimental design can overcome many issues.

Research questions are getting more specific and naucened whilst data sets are dramatically increaing in sized.
